**SAM_SolarCalculator** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository provides **solar irradiance and shading calculation utilities**
used to support solar-driven energy modelling and environmental analysis workflows
within the SAM ecosystem.

---

## Features

- Calculation of solar irradiance on analytical surfaces  
- Evaluation of solar shading and self-shading effects  
- Generation of energy model inputs based on calculated solar exposure
